    <!-- Panels with Information -->
    <div class="panel">
        <h2>1. Technology Adoption:</h2>
        <p>- Encouraging the adoption of modern agricultural technologies such as precision farming, drones for crop monitoring, and IoT-based sensors for soil health management can enhance productivity and efficiency.</p>
        <p>- Promoting the use of mobile applications for access to market information, weather forecasts, and agricultural advisories can empower farmers to make informed decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>2. Infrastructure Development:</h2>
        <p>- Improving rural infrastructure including roads, cold storage facilities, and market linkages can help reduce post-harvest losses and ensure better prices for farmers' produce.</p>
        <p>- Investment in irrigation systems and water management infrastructure is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, especially in regions prone to droughts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>3. Access to Finance and Insurance:</h2>
        <p>- Facilitating access to credit and insurance services for smallholder farmers can mitigate financial risks associated with agriculture, enabling them to invest in better inputs and technologies.</p>
        <p>- Initiatives like crop insurance schemes and microfinance programs tailored to the needs of farmers can provide a safety net during crop failures or natural disasters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>4. Policy Reforms:</h2>
        <p>- Implementing supportive policies and regulatory reforms that address issues like land ownership, tenancy laws, and agricultural marketing can create a more conducive environment for farming.</p>
        <p>- Encouraging sustainable practices through incentives for organic farming, agroforestry, and water conservation can promote environmental stewardship while ensuring long-term agricultural viability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>5. Capacity Building and Education:</h2>
        <p>- Investing in farmer education and extension services to impart modern agricultural practices, crop diversification, and sustainable farming techniques can enhance farmers' skills and resilience.</p>
        <p>- Establishing agricultural research institutions and fostering collaboration between academia, research organizations, and the private sector can drive innovation and knowledge dissemination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>6. Market Linkages and Value Addition:</h2>
        <p>- Strengthening farmer-producer organizations and cooperatives can empower farmers to collectively negotiate better prices and access markets directly.</p>
        <p>- Promoting food processing industries and value addition enterprises can create additional income opportunities for farmers and reduce post-harvest losses by adding value to agricultural produce.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>7. Climate Resilience:</h2>
        <p>- Developing climate-smart agricultural practices and promoting the cultivation of climate-resilient crops can help farmers adapt to changing weather patterns and mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture.</p>
        <p>- Investing in research and development of drought-resistant seeds, efficient irrigation technologies, and sustainable farming practices tailored to local agro-climatic conditions is essential for building resilience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <h2>8. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):</h2>
        <p>- Encouraging collaboration between the government, private sector, and civil society organizations through PPP models can leverage resources and expertise to address various challenges in the agriculture sector.</p>
